# Compute
There is amazing computing power available to professionals and hobbyists alike at very low prices thanks to powerful economies of scale. Large companies, e.g. Facebook, have brought the price of computing on platforms such as Amazon Web Services or DigitalOcean to competitively low prices. Remarkably, thanks to the scalability of computing power on these platforms, the same low prices offered to large corporations are available to individuals working on DIY or just-for-fun projects that are relatively small in scale.

## Terraform
[Terraform](www.terraform.io) is a coding language for managing computer resources. The configuration of compute resources can be complicated and the terraform language can bring a degree of organization, reproducibility, and self-documentation through code.

# Host system configuration

### Install awscli

# AWS examples

## Set up a remote backend
A remote backend is useful for keeping a backup of compute infrastructure state, and allows the management of infrastructure from any online machine.

## How to make an AWS bucket and share it
The easiest way to share files is to make the bucket public.

Terraform is a great tool for creating and managing resources across various computing platforms.
