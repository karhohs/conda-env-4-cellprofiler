# Windows Notes
1. Show file extensions in Windows Explorer. From the Cortana search bar enter, "file extensions" and the control panel item will appear in the search results. I like to adjust the following:
  * Uncheck *Hide extensions for known file types*.
  * Check *Display the full path in the title bar*.
  * Select the radio button for *Show hidden files, folders, and drives*.

  In essence, the more information readily displayed the better.
1. Choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" when installing git to add Unix style commands to the command prompt.
1. Activate Bash on Windows.
  1. Search for "turn windows features" in the Cortana search. Open the dialog box.
  1. Check the box for "Windows subsystem for linux".
    1. Restart the computer
  1. Go to the Windows Store and search for and install Ubuntu (or some other linux distro)
