# CPU-ID
Tools for monitoring the nitty-gritty details of a computer. What I like most is the temperature information and the part number information for hardware. I think the level of detail exceeds Windows and Mac system information.

## CPU-Z
A tool for measuring CPU performance

## HWMonitor
A tool for measuring hard drive performance in addition to other assorted computer components.
