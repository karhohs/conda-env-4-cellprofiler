In Dungeons & Dragons, before an adventure can begin, the heroes must be created. This process is structured and guided by a template known as the character sheet, which is used to collect information all heroes share despite the wide range of abilities and diverse origins that define an individual. This project "character sheet" serves the same purpose. It is a template to be used when first starting a project. The project character sheet will lead to a collection of projects that are diverse and unique, but will be immediately familiar upon review. It is an organization that I have cobbled together through trial and error and has helped me launch into new adventures in data well equipped to face the unexpected and unknown.

# Each project will have a starting Jupyter notebook.

# Each project will have a slide deck and maintain slide resources.
Slide resources are images, scripts to create visuals, source data, PDF references, etc. that are stored outside of the slides for archival purposes. Google Slides are not compatible with git version control or GitHub, so this is a place to keep the work the happens before something is added to a slide. 

# Each project will have a README.md.

# Each project will have a tag that makes it searchable in email and to-do lists
