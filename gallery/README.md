# The gallery

Shout out to Mike Bostock, who I've admired from afar. He is a leader in data visualization and has a [beautiful gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery), which I have gotten lost in from time to time. I have often found galleries, vignettes, and short examples more helpful than documentation when beginning to work with a new package, because my coding style is very copy-and-paste. I often use these examples as templates or seeds for my own scripts or visualizations. When I find a solution that works I often want to return to the well and copy-and-paste from my own code snippets (and if it is so handy it might be worth defining a class of method). This gallery is a collection of examples I have a habit of returning to or I feel help convey some useful concept or technique.
